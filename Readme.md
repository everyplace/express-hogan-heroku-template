Dear New Employee,

Welcome to Happitec Corporation!  As you know, the Happitec motto is "We'll
bring a smile to your computer."  We aim to make people happy, and that includes
our employees here at Happitec.  You have already learned of the many benefits
we offer you!  In turn, we expect you to make us happy by being a dedicated,
responsible employee.

How do you make Happitec happy?  No problem!  We keep things rolling smoothly
simply by following the rules and regulations set down by our founder and
president, Leo J. Zereb.  And to make sure you learn every one of these rules
and regulations, we're sending you to a special training seminar at Happitec
International Headquarters in Paris, France!

That's right, you're going on a two-week, all-expenses-paid trip to Paris,
courtesy of Happitec.  You'll enjoy a six-day training seminar with experienced
Happitec staff members.  Then you'll thrill to a full week of fun in the City of
Lights!  And that's not all! You'll also get $75 spending money!  Does that put
a great big Happitec smile on your face, new employee?

The $75 money order is in the mail to your new home.  To obtain your airline
ticket, simply take this letter to your travel agency.  Then you're on your way
to Paris!  Be sure to be on time for your flight. We've found that new employees
who miss the training seminar usually aren't very happy at Happitec.

See you at the office!


Happily yours,

Ollie Fassbaum
Manager

[The Happitec logo at the top of the screen is a rather crude design that was
obviously done on a computer. Inside a very basic drawing of a computer monitor
is a happy face. They eyes are almost heart-shaped, but were made with square
blocks. The line that represents the smiling mouth has a jagged appearance
because it uses straight segments and makes 90-degree turns.]
